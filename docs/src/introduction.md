Production ready Authentication Server boilerplate for Node.js/Typescript and SQL tool chain 

The application is built with the following reasons in mind:
1.  To provide a minimal authentication server that can be coupled with a frontend (or mobile) application to provide basic authentication and authorization.

2. As a guide for developers who want to build their own authentication server.

3. To serve as a boilerplate for (backend) developers who don't want to start from scratch when building their own authentication server.

4. To serve as a learning resource for developers who want to learn how to build an authentication server especially with Node.js, Express.js, Typescript and SQL.
